For your beginner-level Student Management System project, here are some additional requirements you can consider implementing:

### Core Features:

1. **Student Details:**

   * Store information like name, age, gender, student ID, and contact details.
   * GPA calculation method (e.g., based on grades for various subjects).
2. **Student Search Function:**

   * Ability to search for students by their ID or name.
3. **Student Report Generation:**

   * Generate a report showing the GPA and classification (excellent, good, average) for each student.
4. **Sort Students:**

   * Sort students by name, GPA, or student ID.

### Additional Features:

1. **Attendance Management:**

   * Track student attendance (present, absent, or excused).
   * Store and display attendance statistics.

2. **Multiple Subjects and Grades:**

   * Allow students to have multiple subjects and grades.
   * Calculate GPA based on individual subject scores.

3. **Admin and Teacher Privileges:**

   * Implement roles: Admin (can add, update, delete students) and Teacher (can view and update grades for students).

4. **Student History:**

   * Maintain a history of students (e.g., past grades or attendance).

5. **Menu System:**

   * Create a text-based menu to interact with the system (e.g., Add Student, View Students, Delete Student, Exit).

6. **Error Handling:**

   * Ensure input validation for fields like GPA, age, or student ID.

7. **Data Persistence:**

   * Implement file handling (save data to a file when the program exits and load it when the program starts).

### Bonus Feature:

* **Student Ranking:**

  * Create a ranking system based on GPA to show top performers.

These features will allow you to practice OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism while keeping the project manageable for a beginner.
